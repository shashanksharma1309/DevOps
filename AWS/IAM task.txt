Create a New IAM User:

1.Create a new IAM user with programmatic access.
Assign appropriate permissions to the user based on their role or responsibilities.
Generate and securely provide the user's access key and secret access key.
Configure IAM Roles:

2.Create an IAM role for EC2 instances or Lambda functions with specific permissions.
Attach policies to the role that grant necessary permissions to access AWS resources.
Assign the role to EC2 instances or Lambda functions.

3.Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):

Enable MFA for IAM users to provide an additional layer of security.
Guide users on how to set up MFA devices (such as virtual MFA apps or hardware tokens).
Test the MFA configuration to ensure it functions correctly.
Create IAM Policies:

4.Write a custom IAM policy that allows or denies specific actions on AWS resources.
Associate the policy with the appropriate IAM users, groups, or roles.
Test the policy to verify that the desired access control is enforced.
Use IAM Groups:

5.Create an IAM group and assign permissions to it.
Add IAM users to the group to manage their access collectively.
Remove users from the group when their access requirements change.
Implement IAM Access Analyzer:


6.Define and enforce password policies for IAM users.
Set requirements such as minimum password length, complexity, and expiration.
Regularly remind users to update their passwords according to the policy.

7.Create user Shubham.shubham can only launch ec2 instance in Mumbai 
region

8.Scenario: You are a DevOps engineer responsible for managing AWS resources for your company's e-commerce application. Your company uses S3 to store product images, and you need to grant specific permissions to different teams within your organization.

Task: Your task is to set up IAM users and policies to manage access to the S3 buckets containing product images. Here are the steps you need to follow:

Create IAM Groups:

Create two IAM groups: "Marketing" and "Developers."
Create IAM Policies:

Create an IAM policy called "MarketingAccess" that allows read-only access to the S3 bucket containing product images. Attach this policy to the "Marketing" group.
Create an IAM policy called "DevAccess" that allows both read and write access to the same S3 bucket. Attach this policy to the "Developers" group.
Create IAM Users:

Create two IAM users: "Shubham" and "Deepak"
Add "Shubham" to the "Marketing" group and "Deepak" to the "Developers" group.
Configure S3 Bucket Permissions:

Configure the S3 bucket containing product images with a bucket policy that allows read-only access for the "Marketing" group and read/write access for the "Developers" group.
Testing:

Log in to the AWS Management Console as "Shubham" (Marketing team) and verify that he can only read the product images from the S3 bucket.
Log in to the AWS Management Console as "Deepak" (Developers team) and verify that he can both read and write product images to the S3 bucket.
Documentation:

Document the IAM user setup, policies, and bucket policies for future reference.
